BallisticGame
=============

A simple game that uses ballistic equations and PyGame to display cannon balls trajectories.

The cannon sprite is from "Shonen Jump's One Piece" for GBA (ripped by dimps).

Motivation
----------

The motivation for this project was a conversation with a friend, when he told me how his undergraduate project finished not being like what he wanted. It was a educational game to teach children about the importance of recycling trash and he wanted to have some kind of cannon shooting trash at the correct trash bins. He couldn't do that because he didn't know the equations of motion and couldn't compute the trajectories of the objects. I told him I knew how to do that and created this project to show him and maybe help other peoples trying to do the same.
